# AI-Driven Route Optimization with Weather Image Correlation

This project showcases an AI system for finding the shortest route on a map, incorporating an innovative approach that correlates weather conditions from images to influence route costs. 

## Features
- **Custom Weather Filters:** The project simulates real-world environmental impacts by applying filters for various weather conditions, including cloudy, snowy, rainy, and heatwave effects.
- **Image Processing:** Utilizing OpenCV, the system detects and correlates weather conditions from images to modify the difficulty of travel paths.
- **Optimal Route Calculation:** The Dijkstra algorithm computes the most optimal route based on these dynamic, image-driven weather effects, demonstrating a blend of AI, computer vision, and graph theory.
- **Visualization:** The project visualizes weather-affected maps, emphasizing the role of image analysis in route optimization.

## Note
While the map cannot be displayed directly within the GitHub notebook, I have uploaded the `map_tijuana.html` file to the repository. If you would like to view the result, feel free to check out the file in the repo.
