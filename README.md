# AI-Driven-Route-Optimization-with-Weather-Image-Correlation
This AI project finds the shortest route in a map by correlating weather conditions from images with route costs. Using OpenCV for image processing, it applies filters like cloudy, snowy, and rainy effects, modifying path difficulty. The Dijkstra algorithm computes the optimal route, blending AI, image analysis, and graph theory.
