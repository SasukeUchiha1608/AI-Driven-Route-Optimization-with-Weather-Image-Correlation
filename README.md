# AI-Driven-Route-Optimization-with-Weather-Image-Correlation
This project showcases an AI system for finding the shortest route in a map, with an innovative approach of correlating weather conditions from images to influence route costs. By applying custom weather filters—such as cloudy, snowy, rainy, and heatwave effects—the project simulates real-world environmental impacts. Using image processing techniques with OpenCV, the system detects and correlates weather conditions from images to modify the difficulty of travel paths. The Dijkstra algorithm is employed to compute the most optimal route based on these dynamic, image-driven weather effects, demonstrating a blend of AI, computer vision, and graph theory. The project also visualizes the weather-affected maps, emphasizing the role of image analysis in route optimization.
Note: While the map cannot be displayed directly within the GitHub notebook, I have uploaded the map_tijuana.html file to the repository. If you would like to view the result, feel free to check out the file in the repo.
